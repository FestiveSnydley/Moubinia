	<p class="StatText">This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
<br><br>• You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.<br><br>• You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.<br><br>• You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.<br><br>• You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.<br><br>• You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.<br><br>• You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.<br><br>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p></div>
