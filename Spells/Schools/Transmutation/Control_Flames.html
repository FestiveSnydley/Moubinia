    <strong>Duration</strong> Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)<br>
    <strong>Components</strong> S<br><strong>Range</strong> 60ft<br><br></p>
	<p class="StatText">You choose a nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:<br><br>
• You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.<br><br>
• You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.<br><br>
• You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.<br><br>
• You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.<br><br>
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p></div>
