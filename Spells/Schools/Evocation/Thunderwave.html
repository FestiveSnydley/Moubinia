On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.<br><br>In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.<br><br><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p></div>
