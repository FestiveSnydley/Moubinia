	<p class="StatText">When you cast this spell, you make a melee spell attack against a single creature in range. On a successful hit, the sigil of a god of light (typically Pelor or Pholtus) appears on that creature's forehead or most similar body part. At the end of each of this creature's turns for the duration, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. If this damage kills the target, the sigil on their forehead becomes a permanent brand and they may not be risen as an undead.<br><br><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage of this spell increases by 1d6 per each spell slot level above 2nd.</p></div>
