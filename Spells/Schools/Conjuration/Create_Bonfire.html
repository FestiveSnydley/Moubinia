	<p class="StatText">You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spells ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it move into the bonfire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.
<br><br>The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p></div>
